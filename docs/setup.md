# Setup Steps
For this, we assume a decent knowledge of Teams apps deployment, .Net, and Azure PaaS. 

Note, that for all these steps you can do them all in PowerShell if you wish. 

You need Teams admin rights and rights to assign sensitive privileges for this setup to work. The bot app is just a bot that interacts with all/any Teams users - there's another Teams app for administering the solution that should be more restrictively installed.

**High-level setup guide:**
1. Create a bot + app ID. Configure secret + assign Graph access.
2. Create a seperate application in Entra ID for the web-app. 
3. Deploy user Teams app to Teams for bot - we need the installed app ID for configuring the bot later. 
4. Deploy Azure back-end components.
5. Build a docker images for bot + JavaScript application, and functions app. Requires configuration info from bot app.
6. Push image to Azure container registry created in step 3.
7. Deploy compute components to Container Apps Environment with published docker images.
8. Update bot messaging endpoint. 
9. Verify deployment.

Docker is used in this guide just because it gives a consistent build process, but is not essential. You could also build and publish with GitHub actions. 

## Requirements
Check the [prerequisites](prereqs.md) document before attempting setup. Permissions need to be assigned to the bot identity once the bot is created. 

## Create Bot with new App ID
1. Go to: https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/bots and create a new bot (or alternatively in the Azure Portal, create a new Azure bot - the 1st link doesn't require an Azure subscription).
2. Create a new client secret for the bot application registration. Note down the client ID & the secret of the bot.
3. Grant permissions (specified in the [prerequisites](prereqs.md)) and have an admin grant consent.
4. Recommended: allow importer to read online meetings by configuring [application access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy#configure-application-access-policy)

## Create Web App Registration
In Entra ID, create a new application registration for the JavaScript Teams admin app.

## PowerShell Setup for Backend in Azure
There is a script to deploy all the Azure components and configure them. Recommended you use PowerShell 7 or above. 

1. Install Az PowerShell - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell
2. Authenticate with your target Azure subscription with ``Connect-AzAccount``

Now we need to configure some parameters to create the backend, specifically the bot app details and the resource names we want in Azure. 
3. Copy script config file template ``deploy/InstallConfig-template.json`` to ``deploy/InstallConfig.json``
   1. Fill out mandatory values and check the others. This file contains where the ARM parameters file is, and some basic Azure subscription/resources config. 
4. Copy ARM parameters file template ``deploy/ARM/parameters-backend-template.json`` to ``deploy/ARM/parameters-backend.json``
   1. Fill out mandatory values and check the others. This is to install everything except the compute components. 
5. In the project root folder, run: ``deploy/InstallBackEnd.ps1``
6. Installation will take upto 45 mins if not run before.
7. You can run multiple times; if a resources is already created, it'll be skipped.

## Configure JS App Registration
There are a couple of extra configurations we need for the bot app. We'll take [PUBLIC_URL_DOMAIN] from the FQDN from the Azure Front Door created in the backend setup.

### API Access
Configure API access for app registration so the JavaScript app can access the backend. 

1. Set the App URI of the web app.
2. Copy the full URI into the ARM template parameters ``parameters-compute.json`` file: ``web_account_api_audience`` value. This value is needed for the ``WebAuthConfig__ApiAudience`` configuration.
3. Add a scope for users and admins - ``access``. This value is used for the JavaScript app ``VITE_MSAL_SCOPES`` argument/var.

### Optional: SSO for Teams
The URL of the website hosting the app must match the App URI if we want SSO to work (Azure Front Door in our case). 
* The application URI needs to be in format: api://[PUBLIC_URL_DOMAIN]/[JS_APP_CLIENT_ID], with port if not standard. Examples:
   1. ``api://contosobot.azurefd.net/5023a8dc-8448-4f41-b34c-131ee03def2f``
   2. ``api://localhost:5173/c8c85903-7e4a-4314-898b-08d01382e025``

Next, add Teams apps as pre-authorised apps for the web-app as per [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/authentication/bot-sso-register-aad?tabs=windows#to-configure-an-authorized-client-application).

### Add Reply URLs
For the JavaScript app to work with MSAL, the reply URLs must be configured for the web application. 
1. Add reply URLs for a Single-page application - ``https://[PUBLIC_URL_DOMAIN]/``
2. Enable access tokens and ID tokens. 
3. For Teams SSO: also add an extra redirect URL in the format: ``https://[PUBLIC_URL_DOMAIN]/auth-end.html?clientId=[JS_APP_CLIENT_ID]``

## Deploy User Teams App
Next, create a Teams app from the template to enable the bot in your org:
4. In ``Teams Apps\User`` root dir, copy file ``manifest-template.json`` to ``manifest.json``.
5. Edit ``manifest.json`` and update all instances of ``<<BOT_APP_ID>>`` with your app registration client ID. 
6. Make zip-file of the folder with files: ``manifest.json``, ``color.png``, ``outline.png`` only. Make sure zip file has these files in the root.  
7. Deploy that zip file to your apps catalog in Teams admin.
8. Once deployed, copy the "App ID" generated for the [AppCatalogTeamAppId] configuration value. We'll need that ID for bot configuration so the bot can self-install to users that don't have it yet, and then send proactive messages.

## Build Docker Images
To deploy the bot for production, we use docker to build a new bot image with the ASP.Net + JavaScript application in a single image, and the functions app in another image.
* Copy ``src\docker-compose.override - template.yml`` to ``src\docker-compose.override.yml``.
  * Fill out all the build args for the copilotbot-web service - environmental data will be handled by Azure. Config will include:
    * Client ID of JS app (VITE_MSAL_CLIENT_ID).
    * Root URL for web (VITE_API_ENDPOINT). Example - https://contoso.azurefd.net
    * VITE_MSAL_AUTHORITY should usually be left as the default: https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations
    * Optional for Teams SSO: 
      * Login page URL (VITE_TEAMSFX_START_LOGIN_PAGE_URL). This will based on the Azure Front Door created. Example: https://contoso.azurefd.net/auth-start.html
      * Created JS app scope ID (VITE_MSAL_SCOPES), based on domain-name of app-service if Teams SSO is required, otherwise any ID. Example: api://contoso.azurefd.net/e068a350-0000-0000-bfc0-cda3610dde72/access

Start build:
* Build images with ``docker-compose build`` from the ``src`` folder (change directory to ".\src" to run command).
* You will end up with three images:
   1. ``copilotbot-functions`` - Azure functions app image.
   2. ``copilotbot-web`` - this contains the ASP.Net + built JavaScript with your app registration details compiled in via the docker-compose.override.yml changes you made earlier.
   3. ``copilotbot-importer`` - an importer task that looks for usage activity. 
* Next, we need to push them to your ACR that was created with the backend components. 

## Deploy Docker Images to Azure Container Registry
Run the ``deploy/TagAndPushImages.ps1`` script to perform these steps automatically. It'll work if your ACR name in ``parameters-backend.json`` match the ACR created in the create back-end step.

## PowerShell Deploy for Cloud Components (Compute)
Now with the backend created and the docker images pushed to an ACR, we can deploy the compute components in an Azure Container Apps Environment.

1. Copy ARM parameters file template ``deploy/ARM/parameters-compute-template.json`` to ``deploy/ARM/parameters-appservices.json``
   1. Fill out mandatory values and check the others. This is to install the compute components and Application Insights. 
   2. **Important**: make sure "imageWebServer", "imageImporter" and "imageFunctions" parameters both follow this format:
        ``[myregistry].azurecr.io/copilotbot-functions:[tag]``
      For example:
        ``contosofeedbackbotprod.azurecr.io/copilotbot-functions:latest``
      If the value isn't 100%, the Container Apps deployment will fail.

2. In the project root folder, run: ``deploy/InstallCompute.ps1``.
The script will deploy a Container Apps Environment + Functions container app, a container app for the web, and a Container App Job for importer. 

### Update Azure Front Door
Once the compute PS is finished, the PowerShell will give you the randomly generated domain-name created for the web component which needs to be set in the Azure Front Door backend pool. Note: once configured, it may take a few minutes before the health probes realise the new web backend is healthy and therefore work via the AFD public URL. 

## Provision Database
The last step requires some SQL scripts and data to be inserted.

Run ``deploy/ProvisionDatabase.ps1`` to complete all SQL tasks and insert the URLs stored in your ``InstallConfig.json`` file into the import_url_filter table. 

## Recommended: Run Importer 1st Time
The first time the importer runs, it'll enable audit-logs subscriptions in O365 so data can be recorded. The sooner the importer does this, the sooner data will be available. The importer runs nightly at midnight by default, but you can also start it manually from the Azure Portal, under the Container App Job. 

### Manual Setup: Add URLs to import_url_filter Table
Without data in import_url_filter the importer will fail with error:

```
FATAL ERROR: No import URLs found in database! This means everything would be ignored for SharePoint audit data. Add at least one URL to the import_url_filter table for this to work.
```
This is a safety mechanism to make sure confidential activity does not accidentally end up in the SQL database. The system only reports on activity in general terms ("File X was edited by user Y"), and we recommend you add a broad a scope as possible, but this is a step you the customer must do yourself.

### Manual Setup: Run SQL Scripts for Profiling Extensions
If you can't run the PowerShell script above, you also need to execute all SQL scripts in ``deploy\profiling\CreateSchema``.

## Manual Setup - Create Back-end Azure Resources
You can deploy the ARM templates manually if you prefer. 

Backend components:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpnp%2Fcopilot-feedback-bot%2Fmain%2Fdeploy%2FARM%2Ftemplate-backend.json)

Compute components:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpnp%2Fcopilot-feedback-bot%2Fmain%2Fdeploy%2FARM%2Ftemplate-compute.json)

Templates are ``deploy/ARM/template-backend.json`` and ``deploy/ARM/template-compute.json`` in this repository if you wish to copy/paste into the portal manually. 

## Update bot Messaging Endpoint
You've created the bot, deployed the application, but you still need to update the Azure/Teams bot configuration with the messaging endpoint.
Go back to: https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/bots

Find your bot and update your "endpoint address" field with:
 ``https://[name].azurefd.net/api/messages``

That way messages will work to/from the bot in Teams. 

## Required Configuration 
These configuration settings are needed in the app service & functions app:

Name | Description
--------------- | -----------
AppCatalogTeamAppId | Teams app ID once deployed to the internal catalog
MicrosoftAppId | ID of bot Azure AD application
MicrosoftAppPassword | Bot app secret

ImportAuthConfig:ClientId | Importer/bot service account 
ImportAuthConfig:ClientSecret | Importer/bot service account 
ImportAuthConfig:TenantId | Importer/bot service account tenant ID
ImportAuthConfig:Authority | MSAL authority - usually https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations

WebAuthConfig:ClientId | Web service account 
WebAuthConfig:ClientSecret | Web service account 
WebAuthConfig:TenantId | Web service account tenant ID
WebAuthConfig:ApiAudience | Web service API URI
WebAuthConfig:Authority | MSAL authority - usually https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations

ConnectionStrings:Redis | Redis connection string, used for caching delta tokens
ConnectionStrings:ServiceBusRoot | Used for async processing of various things
ConnectionStrings:SQL | The database connection string.
ConnectionStrings:Storage | Connection string. Conversation cache and other table storage

_Note_: For Docker/Linux, values with ":" in the configuration should be replaced with double underscore "__" as ":" is not supported for environmental variable names.
Example: ``ConnectionStrings__SQL`` instead of ``ConnectionStrings:SQL``.

ConnectionStrings go in their own section in App Services (and prefix "ConnectionStrings:" to the name you give there for .Net). 

_Important:_ **If any values are missing, the process will crash at start-up**. Check the local VM application log if you get a start-up error (in Kudu for app services).

## Optional - Deploy Bot Admin Teams App
There is a React web application deployed to the app service that handles administration of bot questions, and other areas. The app can be accessed via MSAL logins or with Teams SSO. Teams is the preferred method as it doesn't require any extra authentication. 

These steps require the Azure app service to exist. 

* Modify bot app registration for for single-page application App registration for MSAL 2.0 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scenario-spa-app-registration#redirect-uri-msaljs-20-with-auth-code-flow

If you want to embed the admin app in Teams to leverage the single-sign-on:
* Configure SSO for bot app registration - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad
* Create Teams Admin app:
  * In ``Teams Apps/Admin`` copy ``manifest-template.json`` to ``manifest.json``.
  * In ``manifest.json``, replace values: ``<<BOT_APP_ID>>``, ``<<WEB_PUBLIC_URL_DOMAIN>>``, ``<<WEB_HTTPS_ROOT>>``
    * Examples: ``5023a8dc-8448-4f41-b34c-131ee03def2f``, ``contosofeedbackbot.azurefd.net``, ``https://contosofeedbackbot.azurefd.net``
    * Note: for localhost testing, the ``<<WEB_PUBLIC_URL_DOMAIN>>`` value must include the port if non-standard. Example: ``localhost:5173``
  * Make zip-file of the folder with files: ``manifest.json``, ``color.png``, ``outline.png`` only. Make sure zip file has these files in the root. 
  * Upload zip-file to Teams admin centre and publish application to admin users/groups. _Careful who you give access!_

## Alternative: Deploy Solution via GitHub Actions
There are GitHub actions in ``.github\workflows\`` that will build and deploy the app service & webjob in one WF and the functions app in another. 

The workflows require secrets ``feedbackbot_PUBLISH_PROFILE`` and ``feedbackbot_AZURE_FUNCTIONS_NAME`` for deploy to work.
